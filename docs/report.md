# Design and Architecture of _Chirp!_

## Domain model

Here comes a description of our domain model.

![](docs/images/opdelt.png)Figure ##: An overview of the domain model

An illustration of the domain model is seen in the UML-diagram above. It depicts the relations and cardinalities between classes and interfaces. It’s only a part of the program shown in the diagram. This is to show how the program is built while functioning as a representation of how the remaining classes and interfaces are related. For example, the repository FollowRepository inherits from an interface called IFollowRepository while also having a relation to FollowService. CheepService simultaneously has a relation to a UserTimelineModel and an AboutMeModel.
